Augur is focused on prototyping open source software metrics.

Functionally, Augur is a prototyped implementation of the Linux Foundation's CHAOSS Project on open source software metrics. 
Technically, Augur is a Flask web application, Python library and REST server that presents metrics on open source software development 
project health and sustainability.

This Augur information site shows different types of data on the progression and development on the Augur application. On the home page
of the site, all of the repository groups that help develop Augur are displayed. Selecting a repo group and a repo, will give the user the ability
to select contributors to see information about each developer. The user can also see the number of commits per day of the selected repo.
Overall, this is a visual representation of the development of the Augur application.
