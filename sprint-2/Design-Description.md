# Website Description
The first page will have a navbar at the top of the page that will include
a home button, as well as 3 separate tabs for augur information that is
different than the information for the repo groups and repos(addition augur
information). Below the navbar there will be a list of repo groups included
in augur. By clicking a specific repo group, the user will be redirected to 
a new page that shows information specific to the repo group as well as a list
of repos that are included in that repo group. From there the user can select 
a repo associated with that repo group. This will take them to a third page that
displays a dropdown menu of information the user would like to see in that repo.
By choosing an information item from the dropdown menu, a graphic will appear
that visually shows the information the user picked from that repo. This 
information comes from specific API endpoints associated with augur that will
be parsed into Javascript objects then displayed graphically. 

# We plan to use include this augur data if there is enough data in each:
1. Repo Groups
2. Repos
3. Sub Project Count
4. Abandoned Issues
5. Contributors
6. Pull Request Acceptance Rate
7. Active Issues
8. Commits Over Time
