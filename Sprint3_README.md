For this sprint we developed 3 different GUI's for users to use with a variety of endpoints from the augur server. We chose to do three different technologies to see which would fit our needs best. The first uses angular and provides the fastest and most modern looking front end. The second one uses chart.js to do all of the graphing, which has the best graphics. The third server uses a simple html UI which we tested to see if it would be the fastest to load the API.

 Originially we planned to host them all on the same server using nginx to serve the webpages, but because angular is deisnged to be used for single page web applications, this wasn't an option for us.
